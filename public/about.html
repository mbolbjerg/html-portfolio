<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Markus, and I am a product manager at Qure4u, a healthcare SaaS startup founded by my family.
  I joined the company to learn how to run a software business, with the initial goal of starting my own,
  but I’ve since become passionate about driving product innovation and improving user experiences.
  I studied Finance at Boston University, which equipped me with strong analytical and strategic skills that I apply to my work.
  At Qure4u, I’ve worked on diverse projects, including enhancing chatbot functionality, improving patient journey data for
  digital check-ins, and streamlining appointment scheduling systems.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy programming, playing sports, and adventure traveling, which allows me to explore new places
  and challenge myself physically and mentally. I am also an active Toastmasters member, honing my public speaking and
  storytelling skills to communicate ideas effectively.</p>
